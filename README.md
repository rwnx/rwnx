### The Encyclopedia of Me 👋

I’m a developer with a colourful background in arts and technology, and a lot of experience to boot. 
This gives me some unique input on both sides of the creative/technical equation. 

At my core, I am an engineering obsessive and I love learning how things work.

I love writing little dumb tools and exploring programming meta through new languages.
